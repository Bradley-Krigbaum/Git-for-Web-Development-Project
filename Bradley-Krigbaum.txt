Stretch Questions

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

    The box model is a visual way of aligning and placeing elements on a page. Imagine put a box inside a box, then a box inside that one, then another box inside that one. The innermost box is the content, the content box is put inside the padding box, the padding box is put inside the margin box, the margin box is put inside the border box. Each element has its own box model. Putting a border around a page is the same as putting a border around a picture or paragraph. Every element has its own set of boxes.
